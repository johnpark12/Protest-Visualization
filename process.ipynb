      " 'the bougainville government has enacted an indefinite moratorium on renewing the licence of a controversial mining company over fears it could reignite violent civil conflict. in december bougainville landowner groups were called to vote on allowing bougainville copper limited bcl to renew their mining licence and potentially reopen the panguna mine, but the vote was split. if we went ahead now, you could be causing a total explosion of the situation again, the bougainville autonomous government abg president, john momis, told the abc on monday. in june protesters blocked momis and other political leaders from accessing panguna to sign an agreement with landowners, which the abc reported would have opened the way for bcl to work towards returning. note: the actual number of protesters was not included in the source, and is based on prior coding decisions. note: the actual start date of the protest event was not included in the source, and is based on prior coding decisions.'\n",
      " 'peter o neill has been reappointed as prime minister of papua new guinea amid a shaky start to the new parliament, with a power blackout and two mps turning up to take the same seat. the opening of the 10th png parliament which has no women despite the highest number of female candidates in the country s democratic history follows a chaotic campaign and election. it included violence and arson, allegations of voter fraud and bribery, and at least one attempted kidnapping. voting finished earlier this month but the election process was not completed until mps from the numerous parties negotiated coalitions and voted for a prime minister. a vocal group of more than 40 mps, named the national alliance, declared they intended to keep o neill from being elected. the months long campaign was fraught with incidents, allegations and violence, and extensive legal challenges are expected to come before the courts. gorethy kenneth, a senior political journalist with the post courier newspaper who has covered three national elections, said this one was not as violent as in 2002 but it was a hectic campaign . airports and roads were shut in mount hagen as counting irregularities prompted violent protests. note: the actual number of protesters was not provided in the source, and is based on prior coding decisions. note: the actual start date of the event was not provided in the source, and is based on prior coding decisions'\n",
      " 'refugees on manus island were braced for potential calamity on tuesday evening as they refused to leave the now decommissioned detention centre amid fears of violent clashes with locals and the military. five years after the centre reopened under labor and took in its first asylum seekers, and six months after its closure was announced after a papua new guinea supreme court ruling, the ugly and potentially violent stand off marks another dark episode in the history of australia s offshore processing regime. all australian and png staff abandoned the site on tuesday morning, heading for the airport, while power and water were cut later in the afternoon. the men plan to sustain themselves on rainwater they have collected in jerrycans, but fear a confrontation with local manusians up to 50 of whom broke into the site on tuesday and looted fans, chairs and other goods. refugees patched up a broken gate with wire, but it remained insecure. there is a heavy police presence on the island, including the png military and the mobile squad , which has been described as a paramilitary force. the situation is a humanitarian emergency, there is no other way to describe it, said greens senator nick mckim, who was on manus island on tuesday. he witnessed about 100 locals in lorengau rally against the relocation of refugees into their community. the locals say the refugees should be taken to australia.']\n"
